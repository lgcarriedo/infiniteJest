##Goals

There are two overarching goals for the project:

1. Learn Python
2. Analyze and visualize text patterns in the book [Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest). 

This will be ongoing and most likely never be finished because the goals can never fully be accomplished.
